Sales Performance & Growth Analysis Report

üî∂ 1. Executive Summary

The total sales stand at $14.44M, with a net growth of 38.48% over the previous year. This impressive jump reflects strong performance in both product strategy and market expansion. The current Year-To-Date (YTD) sales of $6.96M have grown 30.86% compared to the previous year, indicating solid momentum in ongoing sales efforts.

üìà 2. MTD Comparison: Last Year vs Current Year

Last Year MTD Sales totaled approximately $628K, led by the Toys and Electronics categories.

Current Year MTD Sales have surged to around $713K, showing a clear increase across all categories, especially:

Toys: Jumped from ~$250K to ~$215K (marginal decline but still dominant)

Electronics & Games: Showed slight increases, indicating diversification is working.

üîç What's Behind This?

The marginal drop in Toys may suggest market saturation or pricing changes.

Growth in Electronics and Games implies expanding customer interest and possibly new product launches or promotions.

üí° 3. Top 3 Most Profitable Products

Colorbuds leads significantly with $834.94K, more than 2x the next product.

Action Figures and Lego Bricks follow at $347.75K and $298.69K, respectively.

üîç Insights: Colorbuds‚Äô dominance suggests a premium product with high margins.

These three products likely contribute to a majority share of the gross profit and should be focal points for targeted promotions, bundle offers, and upselling.

üåÜ 4. Citywise Annual Profit Comparison
